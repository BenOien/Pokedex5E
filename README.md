Test it out on [itch.io](https://jerakin.itch.io/pokedex5e)

Download the [latest apk](https://niccokunzmann.github.io/download_latest/Jerakin/Pokedex5E/Pokedex5E.apk).

Unfortunately an iOS version isn't available yet and because of circumstances with developing apps for iOS I will only look in to release for iOS when I do 1.0.0
